# Turning Point
Protect yourself, you can never stop going around, shoot at anything that approaches the centre. 

Turning Point is a small project aiming to explore **Game Feel/Juice**. Simple gameplay with a single input from the player (mouse click) to focus on learning techniques to give the player the most feedback for their actions and their environment.

## My Custom Packages
The project includes my custom Unity package **Janito Animation Tools** which can be found in my [Janito-Unity-Packages](https://github.com/Janfra/Janito-Unity-Packages) repository.

## Techniques Applied
I am actively working on this project, so more techniques will be added, however the current list is as follows:
- Camera Shake to emphasize big actions and for impact
- Scatter on projectiles
- Trails on projectiles
- Enemy knockback
- Enemy damage flash effect
- Squash and stretch effect
- Environment background details to reduce monotomy of screen
- Particle Effects on actions and outcomes for impact
- Animations on all entities
- Audio on actions and outcomes for feedback
- Audio pitch shifting for variance
